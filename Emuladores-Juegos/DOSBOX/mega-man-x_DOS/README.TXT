BASIC MOVEMENT 
 
  Mega Man can be controlled with the keyboard, a joystick or with a four
  button controller.  The OPTIONS menu located on the title screen allows
  you to select any of these devices. Below is listed the default settings 
  for the CAPCOM controller that is provided with your game.

                                Running (Dash) is only possible if Mega Man
                                X is equipped with the optional Emergency
                                Acceleration System.
  TO FIRE THE X-BUSTER:       Press and hold the X button.  Weapon charge

MAIN POWER LEVELS 
 
  X is powered by a micro-fusion fuel tank.  His current energy level is
  indicated by an energy meter in the upper left corner of the screen.
  Each time X is damaged his energy meter will decrease.  If all his energy
  is lost,  X's fusion generator will go critical and explode.  However,
  energy depletion can be avoided by collecting the large or small yellow
  energy capsules.  Using the capsules to increase the energy meter,  X
  should be able to function indefinitely. 













WEAPON POWER LEVELS 
 
  X also has the ability to carry up to four Sub-tanks which will store an
  emergency energy supply.  Once equipped with a sub-tank,  any energy
  capsule which is collected while X's energy meter is full will
  automatically be transferred to a sub-tank.  Energy can be transferred from
  the sub-tank to X's main energy meter by using the system status screen.
  Press the Y  button to activate the system status screen and then
  highlight a sub-tank.  Once it is highlighted,  press the Y button to
  drain the tank.  
 
  The X-Buster and its integrated Variable Weapon System are a major step
  forward from earlier Mega Buster designs.  Shot power has been increased
  and X is now able to switch to other weapon systems using the TAB
  key.  Weapons from deactivated robots can be adapted for use with the
  X-Buster.  The weapon power level for the active special weapon is shown
  to the right of X's main energy meter.  Each time the special weapon is
  fired,  the weapon's power level will decrease.  By collecting the large
  or small Blue Weapon capsules,  X can recharge the current special weapon
  and avoid a total loss of special weapon power.  If X is not currently
  using a special weapon when he collects a weapon capsule, the energy will 
  automatically be allocated to the weapon with the lowest energy level. 
THE SYSTEM STATUS SCREEN 
 
  X's internal system status screen can be viewed by the Y button.
  Using this screen,  X can monitor his various power levels.  The
  screen shows all special weapons available and their power levels.
  It also indicates X's main energy meter,  sub-tank energy level and
  lives remaining.  
 
  Once the system status screen appears,  highlight any of the weapons and
  press the Y button.  When X returns to the main screen,  he will be
  armed with that weapon. 



IMPORTANT DESIGN NOTE: 
 
  X is also equipped with an escape unit which can only be activated if X
  has already defeated the Maverick controlling the area.  If the area has not
  been cleared,  the unit will not function.
