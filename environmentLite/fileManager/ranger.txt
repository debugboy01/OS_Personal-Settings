Command Interface

Like vim, ranger also includes a robust command interface. This allows you to manipulate files in more complex ways. The abilities are extensive, so we will only be covering a few:

! = Execute a command from the shell (non-ranger commands)
: = Execute a ranger command
du = Measure disk usage of current directory
chmod = Change permissions of current file
There are a number of flags that you can pass to commands to modify the operation of the commands. They should be used with a dash "-" after typing "!" for shell commands or ":" for ranger commands:

-s = Discard the output of the current command.
-d = Detach the process and run in the background
-p = Return the output in ranger's file pager
-w = Do not return immediately after command execution. Hang until "Enter" is pressed
-c = Perform command on current file, not the selected files
Ranger also allows you to target specific files by substituting groups of files for command operations. It accomplishes that by using placeholders that will be expanded with the correct files upon execution:

%f = Substitute highlighted file
%d = Substitute current directory
%s = Substitute currently selected files
%t = Substitute currently tagged files
For example, if we wanted to change the names of multiple files, we could select them all with the space bar. After that, we can type:

:bulkrename %s
This is a great way to rename multiple files.
